# Potions

This is a basic project to teach Flask. As routes are added, they will be added to the route.


## Routes
- `/`: 
  - `GET`: Returns a welcome message.
- `/inventory`: 
  - `GET`: Returns entire inventory.
- `/inventory/<category>/<id>`: 
  - `GET`: Returns the selected item. Use `/inventory` for complete list.
